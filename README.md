## Project Overview

**SkillBridge** is a student-centric course management system built as a Personal project. The platform bridges the gap between **students looking for tutoring help** and **skilled tutors** who want to teach all under one roof.

Students can explore available courses and categories, find the right tutor, book a session, and after the session is complete, leave a review. Meanwhile, tutors manage their own profiles and courses, while **Admins** have full control over users, bookings, categories, and platform activity.
